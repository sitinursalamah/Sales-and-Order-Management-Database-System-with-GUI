# 📦 Sales & Order Management Database System with GUI

A simple yet functional database management system that allows administrators and customers to interact with a simulated sales and order platform. Developed using Python and SQLite, this project demonstrates the core functionalities of SQL and GUI development in managing real-world transactional data.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and build an integrated database system to **store, manage, and process sales and order transactions efficiently**, with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Python.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- `SQLite3`
- `pandas`
- `ipywidgets`
- `IPython.display`
- `qrcode`, `base64`, `PIL`
- `re` (regular expressions)

---

## 🔧 Methodology

### 1. Problem Identification & Data Collection  
Define the scope of a simulated retail transaction system (user roles, product inventory, orders).

### 2. ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) Design  
Mapped relationships between users, products, and orders to structure database tables.

### 3. SQL Implementation  
Designed and implemented:
- `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `COUNT`

### 4. GUI Development  
Created a **Python-based interface** using `ipywidgets` for:
- **Admin Panel**: View/manage products, monitor customer orders
- **Customer Interface**: View profile, browse catalog, place orders, and checkout

### 5. Transaction Features & Testing  
Tested user flows and ensured that:
- All CRUD operations are functional
- Order checkout generates QR codes for e-wallet payments or supports credit card use

---

## 💡 Highlights

- Demonstrates a strong understanding of **SQL operations**, **database schema design**, and **user-centric interaction design**.
- Bridged backend SQL logic with an intuitive Python-based GUI for real-world application.
- Integrated QR code generation for modern payment simulation.
